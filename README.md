# Uhadni me cislo (Guess my number)

Simple game created in the online course JS: From Zero to Expert created by Jonas Schmedtmann. Great to play with kids :)

Some of the things I have learned during this project:

- Basic manipulation of DOM elements
- Handling of click events
- Generating random numbers
- Code refactoring
